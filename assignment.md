# Assignment: Cultivation team

The goal of this assignment is to verify that you can apply frontend engineering techniques in 
practice. To do so, we ask that you build a React app for a hypothetical part of our product.

## Instructions

To manage a cultivation in the greenhouse, users can be assigned to a cultivation. Depending on their role, they have certain permissions on the cultivation.

In the cultivation team settings the company admins can manage which users have access to the cultivation with which role.

When the user opens the cultivation team page an overview of the assigned users with their role is showed. It shows a table with the name of the user, their role and a button to remove them from the cultivation.

Below the table we see an "Add teammember" button, with which we can add a user to this cultivation. When the button is clicked a modal should open with a searchable list of all users. The user can select one or more users and add them to the cultivation team. When they are added, they automatically get the "Observer" role.

The role of an existing cultivation team member can be changed by clicking on it. When the role is clicked, a dropdown with all roles opens. By selecting one of the roles, the user role will be updated.
